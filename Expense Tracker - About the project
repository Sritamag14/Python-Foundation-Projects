# Expense-Tracker-Python
This is my very first Python project. I tried my hand at building an expense tracker with a menu-driven interface. 
Following are options you'll get to store in the tracker, listed as shown:
1. Add Expense
2. Remove Expense
3. View Expenses
4. View Expenses by Month
5. Set Monthly Budget
6. View Total Expenses
7. Exit
Navigate expense storage easily with the indexes (1-7), add your expense, choose the day, set a monthly budget, and more!
The fun (sort of) part? You get a tiny warning when an expense exceeds your monthly set budget.
